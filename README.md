Sample terraform configuration files to provision and deploy an N-tier architecture in Azure Resource Manager.
* Virtual network with 5 subnets (web, app, data, adds, and mgt).
* 1 Internet facing load balancer (for web subnet) and 1 internal load balancer (for app subnet).
* HA using availability sets.
* Bastion host

Provisioning:
* Download latest version of Terraform for Windows, [here.] (https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) to a local folder, eg. c:\Terraform
* Set path system environmental variable, in PowerShell type $env:Path += ";c:\Terraform" or use Set-Env-Credentials.ps1
* Launch PowerShell (cmd or git bash) and type terraform to confirm installation.
* Code using any text editor, Visual Studio Code strongly recommended ( there is a Terraform extension for VSC).
* Register new application in Azure Active Directory using the Classic Portal, [see intructions here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) and assign the Contributor IAM role to the application user account in the ARM Portal.
* Use PowerShell script (Set-Env-Credentials.ps1) to set the following environment variables (do not version control this file).  

                ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "..."  
                ARM_CLIENT_ID = "..."  
                ARM_CLIENT_SECRET = "..."  
                ARM_TENANT_ID = "..."  


Configuration:
 * Create Azure Automation account in Azure Resource Manager Portal.
 * Open Azure Automation Account and upload PowerShell DSC files in the DSC Configurations blade.
 * Compile each DSC file published.
 * Onboard Azure VMs in the DSC Nodes blade.
